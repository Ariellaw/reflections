I learned how to create a repository, it was easier than i thought. 
However, I have not figured out to to change the color of the text in the git bash and it is berty difficult to read.

 I'm also happy that I'm finally getting around to studying. I have not done this for too long( a week and a half)
 A git repository is very important inorder to keep track of one's work
